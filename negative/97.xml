<title>CMV: I believe that regularly browsing 4chan will make you into a worse person</title>

<OP author="InsaneTeaparty">
  <claim> Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through </claim>, <claim> care about what they post </claim> and <claim> are quicker to throw out insults </claim>. <claim> They will care about how people respond to them </claim>, <claim> but since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity </claim>.

  <claim> Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality </claim>, and <claim> <pathos> people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group </pathos> </claim>. <logos> <pathos> Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, </pathos> </logos> and <claim> any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant </claim> <logos> by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups </logos>.

<claim> On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof </claim>. <logos> Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors </logos>, <logos> ideas about them or things will get taken out of context </logos> and <logos> it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact </logos>.
  <claim> It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" </claim> where <logos> <pathos> people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something </pathos> </logos>.

<claim> Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person </claim>.

  <claim> I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative </claim>, but that <claim> the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site </claim>.

  <claim> Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are </claim>, but instead <claim> means that you are unaware of how much it affects you </claim>.

  <claim> I think this isn't ALWAYS true </claim>. <logos> Some people aren't changed by others that easily </logos>. And <claim> I think your argument applies only to boards like /b/ or /pol/ </claim>. <logos> If you go on 4chan right now to the /wg/ board (wallpapers) or the /vr/ board, almost everyone there is nice </logos>. They are the boards to people with dedication and interests, though.

  <claim> I think those boards are bit more niche and have less users </claim>.

<claim> But I get your point, in my experience /vg/ has been pretty good </claim> since <claim> people in those threads generally like the games they're talking about and not just wildly pissing about </claim>.
