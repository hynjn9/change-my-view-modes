<title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare</title>

  Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions. My argument is as follows:

1) <logos> The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none </logos>

  1a) <logos> Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products </logos>

2) <logos> The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand </logos>

3) <logos> Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare </logos>.

4) <logos> A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are </logos>.

4a) <logos> Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare </logos>. **However**:

5) <logos> Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms </logos> but <logos> helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing </logos>, <logos> which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare </logos>.

My general view is that <claim> people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers </claim>, and <claim> that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether </claim>. Moreover, <claim> this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet </claim>. <logos> <pathos> Face it, meat is tasty (<ethos> and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience) </ethos> </pathos> </logos>

  <claim> I take some issue with assumption #1 </claim>. <logos> Dramatic societal changes have happened multiple times throughout history </logos>. <logos> They are gradual and at times may seem impossible to many, but they do happen </logos>.

<claim> The larger issue is that you are somehow concluding that someone choosing to go vegan gives more demand to large factory farms </claim>. <claim> You are correct that it may reduce the demand for meat from *slightly* less cruel farms </claim>, <claim> but it also takes demand away from the larger farms </claim>. <logos> <pathos> Going vegan means fewer animals suffer on small farms and fewer animals suffer on factory farms </pathos> </logos>, <logos> <pathos> not that fewer animals suffer on small farms and more animals suffer on factory farms </pathos> </logos>.

<logos> Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ethical carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person) </logos>. <logos> The ethical carnivore just happens to *also* increase demand for responsibly-grown meat </logos>.

  I fixed your statement. <claim> Someone who eats "happy" meat isn't helping animals </claim>. <logos> They are simply supporting farms that are somewhat less cruel </logos>.

<logos> Since, as you stated in your first post of this discussion, you reject my first assertion </logos>, <claim> I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on that one </claim>.
