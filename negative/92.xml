<logos> According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken </logos>. <logos> Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature </logos>. Let's call it X. <logos> Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken, but at some point it does </logos>. <logos> An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg </logos>. <claim> The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist </claim>. Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.

  <claim> If we are being really technical, we can confidently say that the egg came first </claim>. 

  <logos> <ethos> The chicken, as far as we know came into existence around [2500-2100 BC.]</ethos> </logos> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Origins)  

<logos> <ethos> Egg bearing animals, however, seem to be [as old as the dinosuars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_egg) </ethos> </logos>

  <claim> From this, we can conclude that the egg came first </claim>. <claim> ^Unless ^you ^are ^talking ^about ^the ^CHICKEN ^egg ^vs ^the ^chicken, ^in ^which ^case ^I ^have ^no ^clue </claim>.

  <claim> While the question doesn't specifically say a chicken egg, I think that argument is kind of silly </claim>.

  <claim> well... yeah </claim>.

  <logos> My comment was a silly way to point out a flaw in your post </logos>. <logos> It wasn't an actual argument </logos>.
