  <claim> American patriots have a general mentality against immigration </claim>. <claim> Saying these people shouldn’t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line , and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on <claim>. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes </claim>, <logos> namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans” </logos>. <claim> I understand why politics use this slogan </claim>, <logos> because they are trying to get americans to vote for them </logos>, but <logos> this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations </logos>. <claim> <ethos> As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries </ethos> </claim>. <claim> The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product </claim>, <claim> but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief </claim>. <claim> I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, <logos> they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality <logos>, <claim> but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault </claim>. <claim> Patriotism is really just this belief </claim>.

<claim> I'm sure you can find many people who self-identify as patriots while also favoring policies that would allow more immigration </claim>. <logos> I'm one of these people </logos>.

<claim> Even if you don't, you don't have to necessarily think you're better than other people because you're against immigration </claim>. <claim> Many of these people believe that it's not our responsibility as Americans to provide for people from other countries, but rather the responsibility of those countries </claim>. <claim> That's not the same as thinking you're better than other people </claim>. <claim> I don't want absolutely no immigration control for people coming into the US </claim>, but <claim> <pathos> I don't think I'm better than the people I'd be denying citizenship </pathos> </claim>.

<claim> I confused patriotism, which is the love of one's country, with nationalism, which is the idea that one's country is better than other countries </claim>. <claim> What you said is definitely true about patriots </claim>, but <claim> I misused patriots to mean nationalist </claim>.

<claim> Believing your country is better than all others is not the same as believing your country's people are better than all others </claim>.
