<title>CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.</title>

<claim> I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes </claim>. <claim> It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right </claim>. <logos> Radicalism almost always leads to violence </logos>, <logos> and is a plague on democratic society and governments </logos>. <logos> Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries </logos>, <claim> the far-left has for the most part been dealt with </claim>. <claim> However the far-right continues to be a menace </claim>.

<claim> I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right </claim>. <claim> These groups are always extreme fringes </claim>, <claim> and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place </claim>.

 <claim> Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed </claim>, <claim> using them as pawns in their ambitions of power </claim>.

 <claim> Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty </claim>, <claim> such leaders are given a free hand </claim>. <logos> On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers </logos>. <claim> Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ? </claim> 

Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. <claim> I see this as a major flaw in democracy </claim>. <logos> Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism </logos>.

 <claim> Instead, I think governments should do much more </claim> and <claim> try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism </claim>. <claim> After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies </claim>.

<claim> Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough </claim>, <claim> and their will always be a few bad apples </claim>. <claim> These bad apples need to be weeded out </claim>. <claim> Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society </claim>.

As other's said, who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are.  Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details.

 &gt;<quote> Zero tolerance, whatever it takes </quote>.
<logos> Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism and their poison should be kept out of the minds of children </logos>. <logos> Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination </logos>.
<logos> In a highly connected online era, it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement </logos>. <logos> When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem </logos>.
 <logos> The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough </logos>.

 <claim> Now, this is obviously extreme </claim>, <claim> but you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness </claim>.

The thing is though, <claim> what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective </claim>.

<logos> Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous </logos>.

 <claim> I don't disagree </claim>, <claim> but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is? </claim> <logos> Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous </logos>, <logos> and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable </logos>. <logos> Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office </logos>.

 Well we have the benefit of history. <claim> The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center </claim>.

 <claim> In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out </claim>. <claim> Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia weren't all that stable </claim>.

 &gt; <quote> Well we have the benefit of history </quote>.

 <claim> So did they </claim>. <claim> Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves </claim>.  Ever heard of the Reign of Terror?  

&gt; <claim> The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center </claim>.

 <claim> And who gets to decide what being a moderate was </claim>, and why is it tied to what the majority wants? <claim> Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives </claim>, <claim> and throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit </claim>.
 
 &gt; <quote> In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out </quote>.

<logos> Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening </logos>? <claim> It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas </claim>. <claim> Also, stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things </claim>. <logos> 100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee </logos>.

 <logos> But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers </logos>? <claim> Genocide is something most of the world has moved past </claim>, <claim> and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it </claim>.

 <claim> I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives </claim>. <claim> However this isn't about being just a bit conservative </claim>. <claim> It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder </claim>.

 <claim> Conservatives don't do this </claim>, <claim> it's extremists </claim>.

 <claim> People thought the exact same thing before WWI </claim>. <claim> They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years </claim>.  <claim> And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it </claim> <logos> considering what's happening in the middle east </logos>. <logos> <pathos> Hell, Rwanda wasn't that long ago either </pathos> </logos>. <logos> And even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented </logos>.

 <claim> One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter </claim>. <claim> One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture </claim>. <claim> One person's murderer is a other's soldier </claim>. <claim> Now, I don't think all these comparisons are true </claim>, <claim> but they certainly aren't hard to make </claim>. <logos> And they certainly have been made throughout history </logos>.  

&gt;Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.

 <claim> Exactly </claim>, <claim> my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible </claim>, <claim> but that what is considered moderate and okay changes </claim>. <claim> It isn't some objective fact about people </claim>. <logos> J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought </logos>. <claim> The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone </claim>, 	and <claim> to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply </claim> and <claim> may cut in 	the wrong direction </claim> (<logos> either failing to get bad people </logos> or <logos>	getting good people </logos>)

 <claim> Your first paragraph is intriguing </claim>, <claim> and I definitely agree with it </claim>. <claim> The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective </claim>. <claim> Although I do think more needs to be done to combat extremism </claim>, <claim> I see where you're coming from on this </claim>.
