<claim> For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities </claim>; <logos> <ethos> IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population </ethos></logos>.

<claim> With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s) </claim>. <logos> A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting </logos>. <pathos> I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child </pathos>. <logos> <pathos> (maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below.)</pathos> </logos>

<claim> I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children </claim>. CMV.

  <pathos> I had parents who were extremely persistent about making sure i stayed on track </pathos>. <pathos> I was only recently diagnosed with adhd a reading disability and im 20 years old </pathos>. <pathos> I graduated on time but i struggled so much </pathos>. <pathos> I failed a bunch of stuff and was constantly embarrassed to show my grades to other people </pathos>. <pathos> I lost hope often because things felt hopeless, which lead teachers, doctors, family and other students to think i just didnt care </pathos>.   

  <claim> An issue is there are a ton of people with "disabilities" more so than you'd think </claim>. <logos> Thats because we teach everyone to think the same way </logos>. 

  <claim> Thats the issue </claim>. <claim> Im really good at doing certain things </claim>. <logos> For example, i can read  , write, and even speak backwards pretty well </logos>. <logos> My brain is wired differently </logos>.  

<claim> I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant </claim>. <claim> It doesnt make me stupid </claim>, <logos> because im capable of the same things just in a different way </logos>, <pathos> but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid </pathos>. <claim> THAT is the issue </claim>. <logos> Everyone has a mind that works in its own way </logos>.  

<claim>The problem isnt always bad parenting </claim>, <claim> though that can play a role </claim>, <claim> the problem is a black and white educational system </claim>. 

<claim> Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for "dumb" kids is the problem </claim>. 

<claim> Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids </claim> <logos> and thats because its not tapping into their mind right </logos>.  

<claim> If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus </claim>.

Yes. I think that builds my initial point. Parents should be educated on how to identify *how* their child's mind works. This is what I meant when I said "100%" on the parents. You're parents would've known how to turn the way your mind worked into a successful academic career, in a perfect world. </quote>
